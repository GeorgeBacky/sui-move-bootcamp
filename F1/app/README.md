## Sui & Move Bootcamp <> End to End Decentralized Application | React App

This exercise is a simple React app that uses the smart contracts and the Typescript integration tests we have built in the previous steps.

The app will have three main views:

- Main view with latest created Heroes
- Create Hero view
- My Heroes view

### Instructions

In an approach similar to the section E2, we will be using the [@mysten/create-dapp](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit/create-dapp) CLI tool to bootstrap a new React app with Vite, and integrate the [Sui dApp Kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) package.

1. `cd app`
2. `npm create @mysten/dapp`
3. `cd <app-name>`
4. `pnpm i`
5. `pnpm run dev`

#### 1st View: Latest Created Heroes

#### 2nd View: Create Hero

#### 3rd View: My Heroes
